# Algorithms Experience
Various data structures implementations + solutions for computer problems (algorithms) using Swift or C++

#### Applied problems
Projects with solutions for almost real world tasks/problems , sometimes with long descriptions to tell about many different conditions about input and expected output.

#### Data Structures
Projects with subfolders for Array, Binary trees, Graphs and Linked lists implementations and related tasks/problems. Some problems could be similar for different data structures, for example task of  search of an element.

#### Strings
Projects with solutions for tasks specific for strings processing.

#### Sorting
Sorting algorithms.

#### OOD
Object oriented design projects.

#### Math
Solutions for problems which should be solved with help of math methods or with using knowledge about numbers properties.

#### Language
Snippets of code to show possibilities and syntax of Swift/Objective-C languages.

#### Bitwise Algorithms
Low level problems which involve using of bitwise operators of programming language.
