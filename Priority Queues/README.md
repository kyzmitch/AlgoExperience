#  Priority Queues

### Applications of Priority Queue:

1) CPU Scheduling
2) Graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm, Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree, etc
3) All queue applications where priority is involved.

4) Bandwidth management.
Many modern protocols for local area networks also include the concept of priority queues at the media access control (MAC) sub-layer to ensure that high-priority applications (such as VoIP or IPTV) experience lower latency than other applications which can be served with best effort service.
Examples include IEEE 802.11e (an amendment to IEEE 802.11 which provides quality of service).
5) Discrete event simulation. See also: Scheduling (computing).
