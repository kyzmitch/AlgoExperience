/*
Given a dictionary that contains mapping of employee and his manager as a number of (employee, manager) pairs like below.
    
{ "A", "C" },
{ "B", "C" },
{ "C", "F" },
{ "D", "E" },
{ "E", "F" },
{ "F", "F" }

In this example C is manager of A,
C is also manager of B, F is manager
of C and so on.
