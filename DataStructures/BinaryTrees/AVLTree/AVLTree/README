###Balanced Binary Tree

A binary tree is balanced if height of the tree is O(Log n) where n is number of nodes. For Example, AVL tree maintain O(Log n) height by making sure that the difference between heights of left and right subtrees is <= 1. Balanced Binary Search trees are performance wise good as they provide O(log n) time for search, insert and delete.

Why AVL Trees?
Most of the BST operations (e.g., search, max, min, insert, delete.. etc) take O(h) time where h is the height of the BST. The cost of these operations may become O(n) for a skewed Binary tree. If we make sure that height of the tree remains O(Logn) after every insertion and deletion, then we can guarantee an upper bound of O(Logn) for all these operations. The height of an AVL tree is always O(Logn) where n is the number of nodes in the tree (See this video lecture for proof).

The AVL trees are more balanced compared to Red Black Trees, but they may cause more rotations during insertion and deletion. So if your application involves many frequent insertions and deletions, then Red Black trees should be preferred. And if the insertions and deletions are less frequent and search is more frequent operation, then AVL tree should be preferred over Red Black Tree.
